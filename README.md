# An User Interfaced Health Predictor using Random Forest Algorithm



<i>Before cloning the project please read the following description</i><br/>

<b>Intro about project:</b>
<p>In present existing system users face many issues like frequently they have want to visit a doctor even when we come across normal symptoms , illness ,injury. It’s tedious task for the user to wait for the doctors appointment long time . generally people are not aware of type of drugs and medicines that are essential to use for a particular disease. Even people are not much aware about the type of diseases and illness that person get affected. Even for every minor reasons also, we have to reach the hospital.</p>

<p>The healthcare predictor system is an online consultation project which is an end user support system. The proposed system allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent online health care system . The system is fed with various symptoms, illness associated with the user. The intelligent system allows user to share their symptoms and issues. Once the symptoms or issues faced by the user are given,then the system processes user’s symptoms to check for different illness ,diseases that could be associated with it. </p>

<p>We are going to use some intelligent techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s symptoms. In these online system ,users can get instant guidance and precautions on their health issues through an intelligent health care system by using SVM(support vector machine algorithm), Random forest algorithm, logistic regression model.In this proposed system Admin can include new disease,symptoms/issues details into the database.Based on the type of disease and symptom ,issues the data mining algorithm works. In this Admin can view various disease its symptoms which is stored in database. This system will provide a proper guidance/precautions when the user specifies the symptoms , illness/issues encountered.  </p>
